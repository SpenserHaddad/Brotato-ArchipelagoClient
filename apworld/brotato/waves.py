    or bought. We want to emulate this behavior with the items we create here, so items aren't just all from the weakest
    or strongest pool when given to the player. This determines the effective wave to use for each item when it's
    received. When the client receives the next item for a certain rarity, it will lookup the next entry in the list for
    the rarity and use that as the wave when generating the values.
