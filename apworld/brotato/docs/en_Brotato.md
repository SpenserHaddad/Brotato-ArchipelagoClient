## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page](../player-settings) contains the options needed to configure
your game session.

## What does randomization do to this game?

When connected to a multiworld, all characters apart from those received in the
multiworld will be unlocked. You may receive characters that you have not unlocked in
vanilla play, but these will be locked again when you disconnect.

Loot crate drops in-game are replaced with Archipelago "check" items. When picked up,
these will send a check to the multiworld. Depending on your settings, normal loot
crates may not appear when randomized.

Depending on your settings, the shop between waves may have less than four slots in it.
You will have to unlock more slots by finding "Progressive Shop" items in the
multiworld.

All game progress apart from characters (weapons and items unlocked, achievements, etc.)
are not affected by the randomizer.


## What is the goal?

The goal is to win a set number of runs with different characters. Depending on your
settings, you may be able to win runs with any character, or your may need to win
runs with specific characters.

## What is a "check"?

Completing waves and runs with characters, and picking up loot crates dropped during
waves. Which waves give checks and how many loot crates are checks are defined in the
randomizer settings.

## What "items" can you unlock?

- Additional characters that you can play as.
- Item drops, as if you had picked up a loot crate during a wave.
  - Item rarity is determined by the randomizer, and the total distribution of item
    drops mimics the actual game's.
- Upgrades, as if you had leveled up during a wave.
- Additional items slots in the shop, up to the game's maximum of four.
- Bonus XP, which is granted to your current run or the next run you play after
  receiving the item.
- Bonus gold, which follows the same rules as bonus XP.
