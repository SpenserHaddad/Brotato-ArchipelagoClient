# Brotato Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- [Brotato](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/)

## Setup

1. Install the "Archipelago Client" mod from the Steam Workshop (TODO: Link).
2. Launch Brotato.
3. Press the "Archipelago" button on the main menu, and in the new menu that appears
   enter your connection information then press "Connect".

## Archipelago Text Client

The Brotato mod acts as a client to Archipelago, so you do not need to launch a separate
client. However, you may find it useful to keep the Archipelago Text Client (included in
the Archipelago installation by default) open alongside Brotato to keep track of
Multiworld progress.
